## Getting Started
To get started with the iPlus-MES, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
  - You need [iplus-framework](https://github.com/iplus-framework/iPlus) first. Read and clone it.
  - Then: git clone https://github.com/iplus-framework/iPlusMES.git
  - Make sure to clone this repository into the same root path as iplus-framework. (So that our repositories are all in a common directory, so that the specified relative paths match.)

3. **Install a Microsoft SQL-Server Edition:**  
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16

4. **Restore a MES-database file:**  
Restore the SQL Server backup file located in the "Database" folder. Use the IPCDrivesV5-database for playing and exploring features. Use iplusMESV5 for starting building you own MES from scratch.

5. **Open project in Microsoft Visual Studio:**
  - Modify the ConnectionStrings.config file, Follow the instructions on [gipSoft's documentation site](https://iplus-framework.com/en/documentation/Read/Index/View/b00675a8-718c-4c13-9d6d-5e751397ac5f?chapterID=193d292e-df31-405e-a3e9-f1116846bf86#ItemTextTranslationID_d0551cc7-f767-4790-8ecb-8771836ebac7)
  - Compile the solution an set gip.mes.client.exe as start project.

6. **Execute gip.mes.client.exe:**
  - Login with "superuser":"superuser".
  - ü§ó Have fun trying it out and watch our videos to get started. However, we recommend [online training](https://iplus-framework.com/en?section=Support%20%26%20Training#d57ccb45-9050-41cb-a177-9e8c05028931).

## Limitations
The following features and bugs, from Microsoft's repositories, prevent the efficient and productive use of iplus-MES:

1. Ability to refresh a context from the database
https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/16491  
This point is problematic if you are working with long-term database contexts and already loaded entity objects and relationships to other objects have to be reloaded from the database. An example would be if you change a workflow on the client side that was already in use on the server side and it has to be reloaded.

2. DetectChanges slow in long term contexts
https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/31819  
This point is problematic when you work with long-term database contexts and larger amounts of data, because the system then becomes slow.

**IMPORTANT: Please GIVE these issues a THUMBS-UP üëç so that they can be prioritized and Microsoft developers can finally start implementing them.**  
If you want to use the MES system in productive operation, then you have to wait for the fix from the EF team or you can use our previous version 4 of iplus-MES, which works with Entity Framework 4. If you build your own additional developments on it, the program code that you develop is compatible with this V5 version and you can then later convert your libraries to dotNET 8 with little adaptation work.
