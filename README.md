## Getting Started
To get started with the iPlus-MES, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
  - You need [iplus-framework](https://github.com/iplus-framework/iPlus) first. Read and clone it.
  - Then: git clone https://github.com/iplus-framework/iPlusMES.git
  - Make sure to clone this repository into the same root path as iplus-framework. (So that our repositories are all in a common directory, so that the specified relative paths match.)

3. **Install a Microsoft SQL-Server Edition:**  
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16

4. **Restore a MES-database file:**  
Restore the SQL Server backup file located in the "Database" folder. Use the IPCDrivesV5-database for playing and exploring features. Use iplusMESV5 for starting building you own MES from scratch.

5. **Open project in Microsoft Visual Studio:**
  - Modify the ConnectionStrings.config file, Follow the instructions on [gipSoft's documentation site](https://iplus-framework.com/en/documentation/Read/Index/View/b00675a8-718c-4c13-9d6d-5e751397ac5f?chapterID=193d292e-df31-405e-a3e9-f1116846bf86#ItemTextTranslationID_d0551cc7-f767-4790-8ecb-8771836ebac7)
  - Compile the solution an set gip.mes.client.exe as start project.

6. **Execute gip.mes.client.exe:**
  - Login with user "superuser" and password "superuser" to **start as a client**. Login with user "00" and password "00" to **start as a service**. After starting the service, your local IP is remembered and you can start a second instance an logon as client to establish the Client-Server-Connection. If you have problems, that the Client doesn't connect with the server read the [network configuration section](https://iplus-framework.com/en/documentation/Read/Index/View/b00675a8-718c-4c13-9d6d-5e751397ac5f?chapterID=a7424f03-cbff-4f68-90eb-262b3fdcba1c#ItemTextTranslationID_bf788469-8a2f-4a7c-ad78-2710960096dc). For [running on Linux read here](https://iplus-framework.com/en/documentation/Read/Index/View/b00675a8-718c-4c13-9d6d-5e751397ac5f?chapterID=9df14383-a4e5-4a3d-81d5-5dccf80d6c4e).
  - *Important: Every time you pull a newer version from GitHub, you should **hold down the CTRL key** while clicking on the [login button in the login window](https://iplus-framework.com/en/documentation/Read/Index/View/b00675a8-718c-4c13-9d6d-5e751397ac5f?chapterID=ca1a96f0-233d-4e6c-9cfc-d1db683e4be3#ItemTextTranslationID_e24a12c4-649d-4903-abf0-8366ed656ca1) so that your local databases are updated.* Otherwise, the application will not be able to start.

## Limitations
We have a [fork of entity framework core](https://github.com/iplus-framework/efcore/tree/ef_for_iPlus_compilable) that fixes the following issues:
1. Ability to refresh a context from the database
https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/16491  
This point is problematic if you are working with long-term database contexts and already loaded entity objects and relationships to other objects have to be reloaded from the database. An example would be if you change a workflow on the client side that was already in use on the server side and it has to be reloaded.

2. DetectChanges slow in long term contexts
https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/31819  
This point is problematic when you work with long-term database contexts and larger amounts of data, because the system then becomes slow.

3. Reverting changes
https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/14594

If you want to use **iPlus for productive operation** use this release 9.0 fork instead of the official nuget packages. Open the [Directory.Build.props](https://github.com/iplus-framework/iPlus/blob/main/Directory.Build.props) file and set **UseEFCoreForkIPlus to True to** include the compiled ef-assemblies.
